## Hi, how are you?

Thank you for visiting my resumÃ©!

I like to describe myself as a person with many interests, diverse skills and experiences.
Although trained as an art-historian, I've always enjoyed tinkering on computers a bit more than the average history scholar. This interest eventually led me to my first professional IT job working as a Software Test Engineer at the VUB.

Whether it is an organisational challenge, building a website or writing an article; I always strive to deliver the best results possible. Specifically given my limited time, energy and resources. Coming to new challenges, I draw on my diverse past experiences and the valuable insights they have given me. Presented with a difficult problem I stay persistent in resolving the issue - individually or as actively teamworking.
More often than not, I can trust on creativity for problemsolving. I love learning new skills and expand them to my knowledge base.

In my freetime i enjoy playing guitar, bouldering, travelling, taking care of my plants and doing amateur restoration projects. 

Please take a look at my [blogposts](https://www.rreybrou.pro/blog) to further discover what I'm passionate about.ðŸ™‚

greetings!

<br/>
