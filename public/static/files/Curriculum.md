Hi, how are you!?

I like to describe myself as a person with many interests, diverse skillset and experiences. 
As an Art-Historian, I've always enjoyed tinkering on computers a little bit more than the average historian. This interest eventually led me to my first professional IT job working as a Software Test Engineer at the VUB.

Through this blog, I want to showcase the versatility of my personality and the quality of my work. 
Whether it is organisational, building a website or writing an article; I always strive to deliver the best results possible. Specifically given my limited time, energy and resources.
Coming to new challenges, I draw on my diverse past experiences and the valuable insights they have given me. Presented with a difficult problem I stay persistent and will find a way to solve it. 
More often than not I can also trust on creativity for problem solving. In general I love learning new hard aand soft skills and expand them to my knowledge base.

In my freetime i enjoy playing guitar, bouldering, travelling, taking care of my plants and doing amateur restoration projects (Which i plan to showcase here soon!). 

Please take a look at my blog posts to further discover what I'm passionate about,

Thank you for visiting my resum√©.üôÇ
