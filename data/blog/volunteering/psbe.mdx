#  1. <a name='Summary'></a>Revisiting mental healthcare

We live in a society where we observe an increase in mental health disorders and a clear lack of ways to provide an answer to this suffering. 
[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9553847/) proves the underestimated and beneficial value of psychedelics to contribute to this answer, additionally optimizing mental health.<br/>

The Belgian branch of the Psychedelic Society aims to be an educational hub, to gather sources of interest and interested parties, with a clear goal to **objectively inform** our society about the potentials of psychedelics on quality of mental health.
[PSBE](https://psychedelicsocietybelgium.org/) aims to achieve this by raising money to promote and fund research in Belgium. Here, cooperation with Flemish and French speaking universities is essential. 
Furthermore they aim to start the conversation with policy makers to legally regulate the usage of psychedelics for the treatment of different psychological and therapeutic conditions.

I wanted to volunteer because I share their beliefs that psychedelics can be utilised by professionals within the field of psychotherapy, ultimately helping patients with their suffering. As Social Media Marketeer i made online posts mostly regarding concluding latest research.
Besides social media there was also alot of eventplanning involved. Psbe organises monthly meet ups for the community and I'm proud to have also contributed to organisiing the bigger educational events decribed here below.

##  1.1. <a name='Symposium'></a>First Symposium on Psychedelic Science in Belgium @VUB

Research and regularization of the use of psychedelics is currently nonexistent in Belgium, in contrast to our neighboring countries the Netherlands, Germany and Great-Britain.
In these countries, the value of psychedelics (including MDMA) for treatment of different psychological conditions is gaining momentum, and medicalization as well as legalization lie ahead.<br/>

The current legal framework in Belgium does not (yet) allow healthcare providers to be trained regarding the use of psychedelics and MDMA in a therapeutic setting, despite the existence of (expensive) programs abroad providing know-how and expertise. Our NPO aims to work together with these educational programs and establish Belgian training institutions as well.

##  1.2. <a name='Lecture'></a>Lecture on Substance Use Disorders @De Warande

Substance use disorders (SUDs) have far-reaching implications and the way today's society thinks about them can be moralizing. 
SUDs are also generally poorly understood, be it be from psycho-, social- or neurological standpoint and as our culture and society evolve, the types of addictions we see get broader and are no longer even limited to being substance-based. 
It is a sensitive, very personal topic and the options people have today in getting help are limited. We believe a shift is needed from punishing and shaming addictions, towards better understanding and handling them from a healthcare perspective. 
Psychedelic-assisted therapy may prove to be a useful alternative in the toolbox of those who are struggling with a substance use disorder.

We were therefore honored to provide the stage for the experts and researchers with first-hand experience in helping patients. Join us in exploring the question: What role can psychedelics have in substance use disorders?

# 2. My take and learnings

My volunteer experience as a social media marketer for this organisation was very enriching.  
It taught me how to communicate effectively and responsibly with the audience, especially on sensitive topics related to psychedelics and mental health. 
I was happy to find out that PSBE implements a rigorous peer review process of the external communication, which involved the feedback and guidance of professional mental health workers.

The challenge of organising and supporting various events was also enjoyable. 
My main role was to handle the technical aspects, such as projection, sound and recording with OBS (open broadcast software). 
This gave me valuable skills and knowledge in this area, as well as in the broader field of psychedelic advocacy and education.
