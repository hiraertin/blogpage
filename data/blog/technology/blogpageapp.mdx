#  1. <a name='Summary'></a>Introduction and motivation 

Hi! Finally getting there,<br/>

I've been contemplating how to go about showcasing various projects, writings and my resum√©. My online portfolio if you will. I see this as an opportunity to learn new skills, which I expect to be beneficial for my professional career.
At the same time this blog will enable me to quickly share some of my work and provide an interesting platform for further development. 

One might ask "why going this route instead of using social media for sharing your content? Well, I guess because it felt more rewarding and liberating this way. 

So it was decided, let's make it happen!

 <div className="relative aspect-[2/1] w-full">
  ![Alt Text](/static/images/rainbow_kitty.gif)
  </div>

##  1.1. <a name='Features'></a> Startingpoint   

So where does somebody with little experience and some rusty knowledge about html, css and js actually start? Well, what about linking a cute (but stock) [NYAN cat](https://www.nyan.cat/) gif! Thankfully my talks with brogrammer Bert and youtube videos from Fireship helped me on the way to modern js and css frameworks.
Looking back I now better realise the complexity of programming and the vast amount of knowledge necessary to be a good developer. Nevertheless, diving headfirst into this project proved immensely rewarding, and also strengthens my belief in taking this approach.    
 
If you like this blogpage then technically all credits should go to [Timothy Lin](https://github.com/timlrx), the project author of the blogtemplate. Along the way I've decided to use this popular Next.js, Tailwind CSS blogging starter template from [GitHub](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#readme) for various reasons.
Using a template hardly compares to something built from the ground up, but this still enables me to customise the app and implement new features. It got me here much much faster,   


<br/>

#  2. <a name='Features'></a> What did I need?

So, what did these webpages absolutely needed to pack and what did I wanted/wished for them to have? Down below I've listed my first requierements and nice to have's. 
My plan is to develop these requirements with sharpened technical skills along the way. 

##  2.1. <a name='Features'></a>Initial requirements   

Before stumbling on the template I actually had made a list where I wouldn't quite distinguish between requierements and "nice to have" features. Looking back, the template covered all strictly necessary stuff: 

<details>
 <summary><b>Requierements</b></summary>

- ‚úîÔ∏è Mobile friendly responsiveness. 
- ‚úîÔ∏è Modern design UI/UX. 
- ‚úîÔ∏è Markdown friendly. (I believe in simplicity).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Properly displaying Curriculum Vitae and content. 
- ‚úîÔ∏è Working hyperlinks to past projects, social media and other. 
- ‚úîÔ∏è Very customizable code, proper indentation & with well named variabels.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Performant pages. Made with best practices. 
- ‚úîÔ∏è SEO proof.  

</details>


##  2.2. <a name='Features1'></a> Nice to have's:

Secondary features which I believe hold some interesting value.

<details>
 <summary><b>Nice to have's</b></summary>

- ‚úîÔ∏è Table of content in MDX files which can folde and hold links where you slide to.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Download buttons for pdf files.
- üöß Enabling Mermaid diagrams in blogposts 
- üöß Foldable text blocks 
- ‚ùå Translate functions of pages and components in NL, FR, EN, ES
- ‚úîÔ∏è Integrated Searchbar for recruiters 
- ‚úîÔ∏è Dark & White mode
- ‚ùå Morning and Evening mode (idea to extend/customise Dark & White mode)

</details>

Yes, I'm a firm believer of working smarter and not harder! All laziness aside, using boilerplates, templates and frameworks only seems logic if you want impressive results and a nice developer experience. I've personally still experienced a steep learning curve making/deploying this blog. 
The installation of node, react, git and tailwind via the terminal and then wrapping my head around Next JS. Trying to get new features working on a stable build has been alot of troubleshooting, trial and error.

##  2.2. <a name='Features2'></a>Code Stack Ideas

Like mentioned above, getting behind the coding wheel was fun but challenging. How do you know for example that you're thinking/looking at the right codestack for your project? Vaguely understandig that programminglanguages & frameworks have diffrent performances and use cases, I believe being able to handle theses 'tools' is just as an important factor for decision making. The tool is only as good as the person's ability utelising it. 
Another saying i like is that you should always use the right tool for the right job. Professional programmers might relate and could maybe argue that with the majority static content & small amount of visitors my blog has, using metaframeworks like Next JS for a personal blog is complex and excessive? 
(If you want to argue please do so in the built comment section :-) Nevertheless this Next Js framework provides room for upscaling and features like Server side rendering, smart routing with the app router and enabling tailored UI experiences might come in handy.

- Markdown & Mermaid for This Wikipage and Comments
- HTML5 as Markup base
- Tailwind CSS (How to install? Not eager to install it by JS frameworks so i am looking at installation by NodeJS & Npm node Package manager? Although there is a standalone CLI, I'm going ahead and install nodeJS *Stumbled on https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog ; Plan now is to use this template! or play with it!) 
- React for User Interfaces
- HTMX? I t is a dependency-free, browser-oriented javascript library
- GIT (learning it! or use Gitignore?)


GLue  holding my content and developed features together.

although it does not pack everything I wished for.       

So what did it these webpages absolutely needed to have do and what did I wanted it to have? Here were my first requierements and nice to have's:

Work smarter not harder right? 

# 3. <a name='Usage'></a>Rabbithole called development

This project really openen up my eytes to the expertise of developers. My respect for full stack devs has grown significantly.    

whats up with these packages and dependencies... 

Starting this really experienced like a digital minefield that you need to cross. 
Honestly i think I might just got started crawling.   

GitHub
GIT
LInt
yarn 
Npm

Popular metaframeworks like react Next Js, Sveltekit and VueJS


the only limits i now experience is my personal lack of time & technical skills. It was a no-brainer decision starting off from a template, and after some expected setbacks I'm still happy with the build.


I had to pick up where I left 

but is the result of long thought proces and     GLue holding my content and developed features together.

Some of my projects are finished, some came to an halt an might be picked up again day.
it would be nice if these projects had a status sign displaying either (active / on hold / finished).  

 It also burdoned me that my work was not really accesible. My thesis for example has years of effort poured into it, but remains stored in my onedrive (shame on me).   
One might ask "why going through all of this trouble" if you could just use social media for sharing interests and word for writing your r√©sume? Well, tht's because i felt that


Hi!
 
My resum√© ... What better way exists in highlighting my skills then programming an overly complex Curriculum.

Hallo!

Een Curriculum Vitae ... Hoe kan ik mijn ervaring en kwalititeiten het beste in de kijker  

Luckily this came with alot of handy features out of the box.







##  3. <a name='Heaven'></a>Future plans


I guess hosting a webshop, adding a database and some api's would make this more of an app. 

Looking back at my needs a static website would have covered 90% of my demands.

- 3D portfolio  Webgl & JS

I realised that starting from nothing would set me back, compared to this stable build which already housed about 80% of my requierements. 

So I've broken many environments trying to implment new features quickly, without Reverse engineering.

Version 2 is based on Next App directory with React Server Component and uses Contentlayer to manage markdown content. 
I hope you enjoy browsing through my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.


So I was going to build my site building my pages from the ground up in html & css. Little did i know how much web development had actually changed over the years (still really don't btw). My resum√© ...0 
What better way exists in highlighting my skills then programming an overly complex Curriculum.

Note: Time is short and I am already late deploying this. After some assesment and mocking up the structure of this blogpost - I called in some help of ChatGPT to finish my sentences.    



Like mentioned before I was searching for a more personal approach to my resum√©, and this blogpage not initially planned this way. I guess requierements are very Proof is in eating the pudding! And I love pdding!
