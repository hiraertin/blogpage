## <a name='abstract'></a>Abstract

The 16th century painter Simon Pereyns is specifically known for his career in New-Spain where he co-produced multiple monumental altar pieces in Novohispanic tradition. 
Trained in his hometown Antwerp by an unknown master, he left for Lisbon (1557), Toledo (1559) and Madrid (1561), 
where he was employed at the royal court of Phillips II. 

In 1566 his career took a new turn when he established a patronage with Gaston De Peralta the newly appointed Viceroy of New-Spain (Mexico), leading the Antwerp painter on a voyage to the Americas. 
Upon arrival in the colony, an intricate political scheme unfolded for which the new Viceroy De Peralta was summoned back to Spain for testimony. 
He advised his painter to stay in New-Spain because of the vast amount of work and opportunities. 
Shortly after, Pereyns was accused of heresy and fell victim of an enquiry by the Inquisition (a fate specifically shared among migrants from the Low Countries because of their Protestant beliefs). 
The infamous Inquisition records of the trial holds biographic information about the painter, and sketches a very interesting insight in his entourage and 16th-century art scene of New-Spain. This document describes a talented and desirable artist/contractor producing a multitude of high altar pieces. 
Sadly, many got lost but his remaining works show unique Northern Mannerist touches, qualities and compositions.

The presentation highlighted the specific role of Simon Pereyns as a migrated artist from Antwerp and his agency for Martin De Vos’s colonial imagery.

## <a name='about'></a>About the author  

Reinout Reybrouck holds a Master of Art Studies and Archaeology from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (2021). 
His thesis focused on the exchange of Maarten de Vos’s imagery between Antwerp and the Americas within the early modern period. 
Whilst on an Erasmus Mundus program at the Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla (2016), he got fascinated by the emigrated Flemish artist Simon Pereyns. 
Retracing the compelling story behind Pereyns’ career and artwork in his bachelor scription, was greatly beneficial for studying De Vos’s influence in Mexico (thesis).
