## Introduction 
 
What to do when you break your smartphone screen, or your laptop has become a bit old and slow? We daily use higly complex electronics which are prone to break, malfunctioning or underperform for various reasons. In this blogpost I want to quickly share my story getting into electronic repairs and my take on keeping devices updated. These somewhat technical skills have proven themselves very useful during the past few years, which is why I'd like to share them here.


## My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13

It must have been around 2016 when i first dared working on electronics. My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 laptop was equipped with 4GB RAM memory card which I swapped out for an 8GB example. I needed some more CPU power to comfortably learn 3D-CAD drawing and programming. Following the easy peasy steps of a handy [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Install-the-Lenovo-Yoga-13-from-4-Gigs-of-R/), i've managed to double my CPU powers. I remember how smooth the installation went and the satisfaction of succesfully upgrading a piece of complex equipment. A simple little upgrade that has proven itself to be very cost effective, given i just typed these words with it in 2024.

Fast forward to 2024 and I'm really amazed how good this laptop is keeping up with modern software,
A good example was the making of this blogpost for which I‚Äôve used simultaniously CPU intensive application projecting to two monitors without major problems. Although the responsiveness is not the best, it isn't terrible neither.

Over the years I did had to make the necessary repairs to keep my machine functioning. I‚Äôve replaced the LCD screen (after breaking the original) and i‚Äôve [installed a new cooling fan](https://www.myfixguide.com/manual/lenovo-ideapad-yoga-13-disassembly/) after it started to make a [terrible noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcS9Z4EBKU). The noise sometimes comes back when i pick up the pc when it‚Äôs running, so I just decided to treat it as unportable computer.üôÉ The desktop gets the ocasional blue screen, but I don‚Äôt mind. We all get the blues sometime, right?

These upgrades not only gave me additional RAM or saved money that i've otherwise would have spended ona new laptop or repairs, but more importantly it provided me with the confidence i needed to work on electronics. These experieces and skillsets are invaluable to me because they've led me to the wonderful DIY world of repair guide, tutorials, tips and tricks.

The next plan i have for my cherished Lenovo is installing a [lightweight Linux distribution](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lightweight-linux-distributions-for-your-pc/#:~:text=Lightweight%20Linux%20distros%20are%20perfect,from%20a%20minimalist%20Linux%20distro) instead continueing on Windows 10. It is a well known that installing Linux can have alot of performance gains and expand the usability lifetime of computers. Changing operating system might sounds as a challenging task, but isn't that complex once you're able to enter and navigate the BIOS.

## Smartphone's & broken screens

I hope you can't relate but I had the hard way how to take care of my cellphone. I've broken multiple phone screens since they systematically grew bigger over the years. And I'm not alone. According to [article from 2019](https://www.notebookcheck.net/64-of-smartphone-owners-have-cracked-their-screens-new-survey.415577.0.html) only a minority (~35%) of has never broken their phone screen. When phones became smarter, they have also become more fragile (the internet [agrees](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/indestructible-nokia-3310).)

Feeling comfortable opening up computers, starting with screen replacements for me, friends and family wasn't a big step. Sourcing a replacement screen, the right tools and tutorial mixed together with some *fingerspitzengef√ºhl* and tips & tricks got the DIY job done. I would still definitely recommend professionals whenever in doubt or having a more complex model to work on.

## Outro

In a world where phones get more fragile and software is increasingly demanding more performant computers, I believe it to be only normal to adapt circular and repair techniques. There are multiple benefits to be gained, not only being cost effective or sustainable but also educational and informative. I personally like to repair whenever possible and encourage others to do the same. Being able to repair your electronics definitely empowers you as a user or consumer.

Recently I've become aware of a nice local initiative around the [sharing of unused ICT equipment](https://repairshare.be/deel-it-boost-digi-gevers/) and [supporting people digitally](https://repairshare.be/deel-it-boost-digi-helpers/). I personally would love the idea that if my equipment has served me sufficiently, it could still be utilised by someone else. Somebody who has less performance demanding computer for example. This blogpost motivated me to search for more local communities and inititiatives around sharing and repairing equipment.‚ôªÔ∏è
