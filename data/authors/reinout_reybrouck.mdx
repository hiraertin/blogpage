# <a name='about'></a>Hi, how are you!?

Thank you for visiting my resum√©.

<details>
 <summary><b>More information about me here! </b></summary>

I like to describe myself as a person with many interests, diverse skills and experiences.
Although trained as an art-historian, I've always enjoyed tinkering on computers a little bit more than the average history scholar. This interest eventually led me to my first professional IT job working as a Software Test Engineer at the VUB.

By making this blogpage/portfolio I wanted to showcase my versatile personality and the quality of my work. 
Whether it is an organisational challenge, building a website or writing an article; I always strive to deliver the best results possible. Specifically given my limited time, energy and resources.
Coming to new challenges, I draw on my diverse past experiences and the valuable insights they have given me. Presented with a difficult problem I stay persistent in resolving the issue.
More often than not, I can also trust on creativity for problemsolving. In general I love learning new hard and soft skills and expand them to my knowledge base.

In my freetime i enjoy playing guitar, bouldering, travelling, taking care of my plants and doing amateur restoration projects (Which i plan to showcase here soon!). 

Please take a look at my [blogposts](https://www.rreybrou.pro/blog) to further discover what I'm passionate about,üôÇ

greetings!
