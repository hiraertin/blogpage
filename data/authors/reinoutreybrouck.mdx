# <a name='about'></a>Hi, how are you!?

Thank you for visiting my resum√©.üôÇ 

I like to describe myself as a person with many interests, diverse skillset and experiences. 
Although trained as an Art-Historian, I've always enjoyed tinkering on computers a little bit more than the average history scholar. This interest eventually led me to my first professional IT job working as a Software Test Engineer at the VUB.

Software testing has been an instructive experience, where I got alot of joy working on different projects that challenged me to learn new hard and soft skills.  
Currently I'm very motivated to gain new skillsets within the fields of test automation, UX & UI or frontend web development. 
As a self-taught - and therefore modestly inexperienced - web developer, i would love to professionally deep dive into one of these subjects, and make them thoroughly mine.

Through this blog, I want to showcase the versatility of my personality and the quality of my work. 
Whether it is software testing, building a website or writing an article; I always strive to deliver the best results possible. Specifically given my limited time, energy and resources.
Coming to new challenges, I draw on my diverse past experiences and the valuable insights they have given me. Presented with a difficult problem I stay persistent and will find a way to solve it. 
More often than not I can also trust on creativity for problem solving. In general I love learning new practical skills and expand them to my knowledge base.

In my freetime i enjoy playing guitar, bouldering, travelling, taking care of my plants and doing amateur restoration projects (Which i plan to showcase here soon!). 

Please take a look at my blog posts to further discover what I'm passionate about, and do leave a comment when you feel like!

<h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Thank you!</h1>
